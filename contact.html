      <h2>Baybacombe Bay</h2>
      <p>
        Babbacombe, high on the wooded cliffs facing north east is a couple of miles from the centre of Torquay and offers some spectacular views of the red sandstone cliffs and the coastline below. From here you can get to several small sandy coves by going down steep cliffside roads, or in the case of Oddicombe Beach, by the cliff railway. Babbacombe, together with the neighbouring village of St Marychurch is a very pleasant part of Torquay with plenty of attractions on the doorstep.
      </p>
      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p>
        Torquay had small beginnings. In 1800, the population of this fishing village numbered less than 1,000. During the Napoleonic Wars however, Torquay, protected from the worst of the weather by the surrounding hills was the favoured port for shelter during the Channel gales and it served as a victualling and supply centre. Torquay does tend to get better weather than the surrounding areas and as a result, naval officers used to bring their wives and families here as a good place to live. Today, Torquay is a cheerful place, epitomised by the colourful lights which go right around the bay. They're on all year round and it lends a bit of cheer, especially when you see them in January. The town area is quite spread out and occupies a rock promontory which divides Babbacombe Bay from Tor Bay.
